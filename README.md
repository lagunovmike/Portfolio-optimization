# Portfolio Optimization

Welcome to the Portfolio Optimization repository! This project is designed to provide tools for optimizing a portfolio of financial assets using R.

## Requirements

To use this project, you will need R and the following packages:

- tidyverse
- PerformanceAnalytics
- randomForest

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. 
You can do this by opening RStudio and going to the "Git" tab in the "Git" pane. 
Click the "Clone" button and enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/lagunovmike/Portfolio-optimization.git`. 
Choose a directory on your local machine to clone the repository to and click "Create Project".

Alternatively, you can use the `usethis` package to clone the repository directly from within RStudio:

```r
# Install the usethis package if you don't have it already
install.packages("usethis")

# Load the usethis package
library(usethis)

# Clone the repository
usethis::use_git("https://github.com/lagunovmike/Portfolio-optimization.git",
                 destdir = "~/path/to/local/directory")
```

## Results

The script will output the optimized portfolio's expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio. It will also generate a plot showing the efficient frontier and the optimal portfolio, as well as a plot of the distribution of returns for the random portfolios generated by the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Customization

You can customize the optimization process by modifying the functions in portfolio_optimization.R. This script provides a set of functions for loading data, calculating statistics, and optimizing portfolios.
